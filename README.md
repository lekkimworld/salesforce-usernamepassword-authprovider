# Salesforce Username/Password Auth. Provider / Named Credentials

Auth. Provider for Salesforce built as the Azure `client_credentials` example I have in my [salesforce-azure-clientcredentials-authprovider](https://github.com/lekkimworld/salesforce-azure-clientcredentials-authprovider) repo. Basically it does the same thing but have a custom flow to get an access token.
